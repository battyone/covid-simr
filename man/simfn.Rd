\usage{
simfn(rep, dates, metric, value, galpha, gbeta, cap, pfat, uncert)
}
\arguments{
\item{rep}{(\code{postive integer}), number of repetitions in simulation.}

\item{dates}{(\code{vec, Date}), dates in siulation.}

\item{metric}{PLACEHOLDER}

\item{value}{PLACEHOLDER}

\item{galpha}{\code{positive numeric}, median length of stay for admitted covid19 pateints, to be estimated by user from data or other source}

\item{gbeta}{\code{positive numeric}, 0.95 quantile length of stay for admitted covid19 patients, to be estimated by user from data or other source}

\item{cap}{\code{positive integer}, maximum number of patients who can be concurrently admitted to the hospital/unit}

\item{pfat}{\code{numeric} in range 0 (no chance of death) to 1 (certain death), probability that a patient who arrives but is rejected/cannot be admitted (because there are no beds free) dies}

\item{uncert}{\code{log}, does the simulation include uncertainty.}
